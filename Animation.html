    <p>From one perspective its about a guy "who never gives up"from another its about two orphans who were victims of tragedy and how they went about it, through a narrative detailing their adventures in the ninja world.

      But that stuff will confuse her. Just tell her that its really about this guy called Uchiha Madara. And I'm not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. I'm not even taling about Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara. I'm talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Madara Uchiha with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.</p>
